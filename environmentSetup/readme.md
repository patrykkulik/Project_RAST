###  Overview of Simulation Team Contribution

This directory contains all work and iterations produced for the purposes of Gazebo simulation. Each folder has instructions in dedicated readme files on how to install, build and run the simulations. All simulations were produced on Ubuntu version 18.04, it is essential that the operating system is this particular version.

A brief description of each subdirectory:

- Wind_Plugin_World - An implementation of the wind plugin into Gazebo
- gdp2020_add -  A demonstration of attaching ultrasonic sensors to an Iris drone to implement ground effect
- gdp2020 - A demonstration of flooded environment with 4 created houses
- final_drone - An attempt at creating a fully integrated morphing drone with a grappling device (not successful final build)
- drone_static - A world showing the imported drone design from the hardware team with flight capabilities (without morphing)
