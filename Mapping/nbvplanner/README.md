# How to compile nbvplanner
* The original repo is out of date for ROS Melodic and Gazebo 9. So changes are made to some files, especially rotor simulator and mav_comm.  

* Copy the folders inside replacement files and replace those in nbvplanner. 

* Use catkin_make to compile, so it's a good idea to place the repo somewhere else than catkin_ws.
